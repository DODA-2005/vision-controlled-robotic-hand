# Computer-Vision Controlled Robotic Hand

A fully functional, computer-vision–controlled robotic hand that mirrors human finger movements in real time using a standard webcam.

This project combines mechanical actuation, embedded control, and real-time vision processing. Hand landmark tracking is performed on the PC, while low-level motor control is handled by an Arduino-based controller.

This repository documents a **working system**, not a simulation or concept build.

## Overview

The robotic hand is controlled using hand-tracking data extracted from a live camera feed. Finger positions are mapped to servo angles and transmitted to the controller over serial communication.

The system was built with rapid iteration and reliability in mind, using a zero-board (perfboard) wiring approach rather than a custom PCB.

Mechanical inspiration for the hand structure was taken from the open-source InMoov project. Electronics, wiring logic, control strategy, and software integration were designed and implemented independently.

## Actuation System

The hand is actuated using high-torque servo motors arranged to provide independent finger control.

## Hardware

- **Controller:** Arduino Nano  
- **Actuators:** MG996R servo motors (one per finger)  
- **Power:**  
  - 3S LiPo battery  
  - External DC-DC buck converter for regulated servo power  
- **Wiring:**  
  - Zero board (perfboard) with point-to-point soldering  
  - No custom PCB used in this build  
- **Mechanical:**  
  - 3D printed hand structure  
  - Tendon-driven fingers using braided line  

> Power for servos is isolated from the Arduino logic supply to prevent brownouts.

## Software

### Python (Host Side)
- OpenCV – video capture and processing  
- MediaPipe – real-time hand landmark detection  
- Custom Python script for:
  - Finger angle extraction  
  - Mapping landmarks → servo angles  
  - Serial communication with Arduino  

### Arduino (Embedded Side)
- Receives servo angle commands over serial  
- Drives individual servo motors accordingly  
- The Arduino sketch **must be flashed first** for the Python script to work

## Notes & Design Decisions

- Zero-board wiring was chosen for speed, flexibility, and ease of debugging  
- External power regulation is mandatory for stable servo operation  
- Latency is low enough for intuitive real-time control  
- This system prioritizes robustness over miniaturization
